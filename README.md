## Lights & Shadows

The files generated by <a href="https://github.com/AR-js-org/studio" target="">**AR.js Studio**</a> work brilliantly well straight out of the box... but here I also added some custom lights, plus a primitive entity to act as ‘land’ for shadows to fall on (both are commented in index.html).

Also note, `shadow="cast: true; receive: true"` has been added to the model entity and `shadow="receive: true"` to the land entity, to enable the shadows.

## Dino Plane
I created the 3D model using <a href="https://www.blender.org/download" target="">**Blender 2.83.4**</a>. Please don’t scrutinise my modelling too closely, I only made it for a bit of fun 🙂
